# Post it! (by ChatGPTðŸ¤–)

This is a simple [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) application that takes user input through a form, stores the form data in a dictionary, and generates a promt message for ChatGPT based on the user input. The application also allows the user to copy the generated message to their clipboard to ease the copy-pasting into ChatGPT.

The project was realized for the SRF ChatGPT Hackathon on 2023-06-03 with the idea to simplify writing Posts for Social Media (Twitter/Instagram etc.) starting from longer Agency Report ([Example](examples/Text.txt)).
